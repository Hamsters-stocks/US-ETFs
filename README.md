# US-ETFs
Historical ETFs members for US index funds.

For all retail investors, I hope you will find the data on this page useful for your trading.

Backtesting is a crucial step to verify your trading strategies. Many investors will try their strategies on index fund members, especially S&P500 and Nasdaq100.

There are many free resources online which you can download the real time ETFs components and weighting. 
However, backtesing with the existing members will cause a undesirable effect of survivorship bias, which will over-estimate your performances and returns.
To better simulate the past market,  past datapoints should be used as the ETF members today are the winners in the past. 

There are various data brokers which sells historial ETFs data but most of them are expensive for merely retail traders. To facilliate the learning of all the traders as well as not harming the intellectual property rights of others, we can use the free and open Wikipedia as data sources.
An alternative way of exploring past ETFs constituent is to view the historical Wikipedia pages about the ETFs company list and scrap down the members.

Please be noted that the data from the Wikipedia is not necessarily accurate. I will prepare a estimated stock lists by a regular basis for your reference. If you would like data from a specific time frame, you can do the scrapping yourself. (It is very easy and starightforward. I have prepared a reference code but the format of Wikepedia changes from time to time. As I have not mastered the coding skills, please give advices if you got any better ways to do it.)
