Historical ETFs members for US ETFs

For all retail investors, I hope you will find the data on this page useful for your trading.

Backtesting is a crucial step to verify your trading strategies. Many investors will try their strategies on index fund members, especially S&P500 and Nasdaq100.

There are many free resources online which you can download the ETFs components and weighting at the moment now. 
However, backtesing with the existing members will cause a undesirable effect of survivorship bias, which will over-estimate your performances and returns.
To better simulate the past market, members at the past time points should be used as the members now are all winners in the past. 

There are various data brokers which sells historial ETFs data but most of them are expensive for merely retail traders. In sight of this, I find an alternative way of exploring past ETFs constituent by viewing the Wikipedia pages in the past to scrap down the members.

Please be noted that the data from the Wikipedia is not necessarily accurate. I will prepare a estimated stock lists by a regular basis for your reference. If you would like data from a specific time frame, you can do the scrapping yourself. (It is very easy and starightforward. I have prepared a reference code but the format of Wikepedia changes from time to time. As I have not mastered the coding skills, please give advices if you got any better ways to do it.)
